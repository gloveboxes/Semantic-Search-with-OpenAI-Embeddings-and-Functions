  "description": "Learn the approach followed in Australia related to the requirements for digital accessibility.  It certainly won\u0027t be boring or technical, but will provide you with the knowledge you need to address the requirements and persuade those within your organisation that this is not just a \u0027good thing to do\u0027, but the \u0027smart thing to do\u0027, the \u0027right thing to do\u0027 and is \u0027good for business\u0027 at the same time!\\n\\nIn this session, we will explore the Australian context of web accessibility including the new Australian Standard for procurement of ICT products (AS 301549), the W3C\u0027s new release of Web Accessibility Laws and Policies which show the Australian setting, the procedures followed by the Australian Human Rights Commission in administering the Disability Discrimination Act and other related materials."
