{"speaker": "Micheline Harris", "title": "When And When Not To Use Deep Learning", "videoId": "bdxDPNIizV0", "description": "In this episode of the AI Show we dive into when and why one would use deep learning over classical machine learning.  While many tasks can be performed cheaply and well with classical machine learning and packages like scikit-learn, every once in a while, a task is better suited for a neural network architecture implemented with deep learning methods \u2013 e.g. large amounts of data or insufficient accuracy with other methods.  Watch to find out more and hear about some Python packages to make life easier."}
