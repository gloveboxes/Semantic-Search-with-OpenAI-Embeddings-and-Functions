{"speaker": "Alex Bocharov", "title": "Quantum Machine Learning and Azure Quantum", "videoId": "6sihiElFMhI", "description": "Alex Bocharov, Principal Researcher at Microsoft Quantum Systems group and Chris Granade, Senior Research Software Development Engineer join Vadim Karpusenko to discuss the impact of Quantum Computing on the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence domains. Touching briefly on decade-old pioneering results in Quantum Machine Learning, the story switches to describe more recent technologies meant for near term generation of smaller \"noisy\" quantum computers. The second part of the interview showcases how you can get started using quantum machine learning with Q# and the QML library provided with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit.\n\nJump To: \n[00:10] \u2013 Introducing Alex Bocharov : intro into Quantum Computing\n[02:16] - What is the time horizons for Quantum Neural Networks in practice?\n[02:52] - Desirable properties of the variational quantum circuits \n[06:00] \u2013 Introducing Chris Granade: How to use QC for ML/AI?\n[06:50] - What does quantum development look like?\n[08:45] \u2013 Do you need to learn Quantum gates to use Quantum Computing?\n[11:05] \u2013 Executing Quantum code in Python Jupyter Notebook\n[13:00] \u2013 Download is available at aka.ms/QML\n\nMore Information: \nQuantum Doc https://aka.ms/QuantumDoc\nML Meets Quantum https://aka.ms/MLMeetsQuantum\nIntroduction to Quantum ML https://aka.ms/IntrotoQuantumML\nQuantum ML Library https://aka.ms/QuantumMLLibrary\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe  \nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/DLvML\nGet Started with Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/StartML\nFollow: https://twitter.com/Vadi\nFollow: https://twitter.com/MSFTQuantum\nFollow: https://twitter.com/cgranade\nFollow: https://twitter.com/ch9\nFollow: https://twitter.com/Azure\nFollow: https://twitter.com/msdev"}
